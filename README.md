# apiDemo


Playing with the [Numbers API](http://numbersapi.com/) and [the Dogs API](dog.ceo/dog-api/)

Click a button to make a call. Doesn't look super pretty but it works. Initally just made an infinite number of new elements but decided to just show update a preexisting one and call it a day. 


Basically just a refresher on how to use APIs and using Fetch
